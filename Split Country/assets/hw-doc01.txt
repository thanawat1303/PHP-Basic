Trump raises NKorea with China, Japan

US President Donald Trump has spoken to Chinese President Xi Jinping and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and discussed the threat posed by North Korea, the White House says.
"Both leaders reaffirmed their commitment to a denuclearised Korean Peninsula. President Trump reiterated his determination to seek more balanced trade relations with America's trading partners," the White House said of Trump's call with Xi.
Trump has become increasingly frustrated with China's inability to rein in North Korea.
Trump and Abe, in their call, reiterated their commitment to increase pressure on North Korea.
"They reaffirmed that the United States-Japan Alliance stands ready to defend and respond to any threat or action taken by North Korea," the White House said in a statement.
